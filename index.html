                    I live in Saudi Arabia. I have to be on duty from 5:30 in the morning to 6 in the evening. I have to work hard, as an electrician. I get very tired when I come home in the evening. Then I have to cook my own. Then I can sit down with my laptop.
                    I try to give 7 to 8 hours daily.
                    I know I have to work hard, I have to practice a lot, to be a web developer......
